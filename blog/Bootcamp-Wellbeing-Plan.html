        <h3>Physical wellbeing</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
          <li>Trying to keep up with my original fitness plan proved too much by the end of week one. Muay Thai training is too draining on the mind and body to keep it up during something like a coding bootcamp.</li> 
          <li>After Talking with Rosie about finding small blocks of time in which I can make space for physical wellbeing, I have started going for small runs about 3-4 times a week.</li>
          <li>Swimming is still possible twice a week; the pool is only a few minutes drive away and swimming itself is relaxing.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>
          Intellectual Wellbeing
        </h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Keeping a growth mindset has been really hard;  every week I have come out feeling even less capable than the previous one.</li>
            <li>If I can remember one piece of information from each week that will be a win.</li>
            <li>It may be that the active participation in bootcamp will/has iterate(ed) a growth mindset.</li>
            <li>I will keep up my own personal intellectual interest when possible in the weekend.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>
          Social Wellbeing
        </h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>I will continue with my fairly minimal social interactions, beyond my family and partner I have managed to see my friends thrice since the start of foundations-bootcamp.</li>
            <li>I have managed to keep up with my regular date nates and will continue to. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>
          Cultural Wellbeing
        </h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>I haven't been able to do the things which are "culturally" important to me as much, which was expected. </li>
            <li>Instead of trying to fit them in I will make a plan to re-engage with them after bootcamp.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>
          Emotional Wellbeing
        </h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>It has been as expected, the first few weeks were certainly the hardest</li>
            <li>I will de-stress and reset my emotional base via mediation, walks and decompressing with my partner</li>
            <li>I will make more of an effort to engage positively with my cohort.</li>
            <li>I will buy a rake and outdoor broom to sweep and rake the oak leaves on teh front lawn to help re-balance my emotional state</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

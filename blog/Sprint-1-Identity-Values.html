          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Once while driving around Wellington with the family, we stopped at
          some red lights near the Basin Reserve and there was a man
          standing/falling about on the left-hand lane. I think I might have
          usually left him and considered it not my problem. Instead, I decided
          that it was problem, and something needed to be done about it, so as
          the lights were turning green I got out of the car and took him off
          the road to the foot path and called the emergency services to get him
          some help. Looking back now I would like to think I would do the same
          today.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I’d say that my core values are likely to be the same as most people,
          but growing up around Londoners really taught me to value being able
          to have a laugh and take the piss out of yourself.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Luckily for me I spent a small fortune on a skills and strengths test
          a few months ago so that I could have my own official psychological
          astrology chart! I joke, somewhat… I enjoy analysis and analytics,
          breaking things down and finding out how they work. I am a hands-on
          learner; I prefer to explore things in an iterative manner first and
          then apply related abstractions after. I also enjoy working in a team
          environment, where each member is supportive and coordinated, yet
          allowed to work towards their own strengths and goals with the
          ultimate goal being the uplifting of everyone.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Understanding the importance and nature of time in relation to both
          work and learning has been a source of disruption. I have often been
          lacking in time-management and thus have failed to set realistic goals
          and parameters to projects and assignments.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I’ve have often found that when a new project arises there is often a
          clash of egos as members of a team begin considering and digesting the
          possible and probably issues and outcomes of one or another approach.
          I have certainly been one of those egos, especially when I was
          younger. As I have matured (hopefully) though I have realised that the
          real joy of teamwork isn’t in having everyone agree with you, rather
          it is in facilitating the abilities of others. Rather than push back
          on a coworker’s ideas I now instead help them explore and execute them
          and focus instead on coordination and lending a hand where needed.

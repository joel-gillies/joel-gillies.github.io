        <h3>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          Ultimately, I would enjoy once again working with, or even within,
          Government Agencies in the area of online access. During previous work
          experience I became aware of how certain digital strategies were not
          always delivering services to every Kiwi in the same manner.
          Developing skills as a full-stack developer would help me achieve this
          goal, someday. But in the short term I am happy to immerse myself in
          new work environments that will allow me to continue learning and
          developing expertise.
        </p>
        <h3>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h3>
        <p>
          Like a lot of people, I can get a little frustrated and annoyed when I
          feel like I’m banging my head against a proverbial brick wall which
          can lead to too much self-criticism. I am also not the greatest
          manager of time due to things like “perfectionism” and unrealistic
          planning. These past two weeks I have been using the suggested tools
          to really make every minute mean something by using the Sprint
          time-boxes, a pomodoro planner and planner. I think with some
          continued consistency my time management can be flipped from a
          weakness to a strength. Likewise, by learning to break down problems
          into discreet parts, I think I can successfully overcome that brick
          wall. I learn best when the experience is somewhat iterative and I
          don’t mind jumping into new subject areas and seeing how things work
          (or don’t). I believe I also possess curiosity and a passion for know
          how things work; both of which allow me to seek out ways of
          reformulating new and complex ideas into a more familiar form.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I would like to continue to work on my time management skills as well
          as develop a greater understanding of how collaborative projects work
          in the IT industry.
        </p>
        <h3>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
        </h3>
        <p>
          I believe I currently work well with others and am capable of fitting
          into a fluid learning environment. To manage my workload I have
          already begun developing micro-time management skills via the use of
          timers and digital aids. When things get difficult I will ensure that
          I continue to communicate with the team and my facilitators. I will
          also make sure I go through appropriate troubleshooting, using digital
          resources to try and fix a problem. However if the problem persists I
          will reach out and seek help from others.
        </p>
        <h3>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h3>
        <p>
          As explained above, I recognise the importance of ensuring ongoing
          communication with my team and my facilitators when I have exhausted
          my own efforts at troubleshooting. I will use the tech-questions and
          cohort Discord servers, if I need further assistance I will contact my
          facilitator directly via dm.
        </p>
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        <p>
          I expect clear and timely communication, as well as an open and
          collaborative approach to issues I may encounter. I don’t expect 24/7
          comms however an understanding of when comms can happen is important.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I have ensured that during the week I am free Mon-Friday and most
          Saturday’s too, although I am committed to my health and fitness which
          means that three times a week in the evening, I’m at the gym or the
          pool. Every second Wednesday evening I have reserved for family time.
          The only specific dates I have booked out are the 6th & 27th of April,
          4th of May and the 8th of June.

        <h3>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          I am hoping that learning to code might open new life opportunities,
          that learning how to code can help augment my current repertoire of
          technical and interpersonal skills and help me grow my professional
          and personal potential. Having previously worked in government, I can
          see a path for me in the development of public goods and services web
          applications. Project planning and management has also been something
          I have had experience with, in pursuing a career within Full Stack
          development I might be able to apply this skill again. Likewise, I
          have enjoyed writing technical manuals in the past, most often for
          general audiences with no prior knowledge of the subject matter, it
          has been something I have always received positive feedback on, and I
          hope to be able develop and share this skill in the future.

        <h3>
          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think my biggest strength is my outward response to pressure and
          negative outcomes, I believe I bring a strong set of interpersonal
          skills to the table and a "no factor" kind of attitude to the team
          environment. That is, I always believe the project is achievable and
          that technical and material deficiencies can usually be overcome so
          long as the team is cohesive. I am afraid that biggest limitation is a
          technical one, that this will inevitably lead sustained periods of
          confusion about the syntax and the internal logic of the coding
          languages we will be using.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
          will be?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Staying on top of the material is my major concern, as I have already
          experienced certain kind of lag between myself and others during
          Foundations. Prolonged instances of confusion can lead to increasing
          instances of directionless thinking, which in turn produce periods of
          self-doubt.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I would like to get better at admitting a lack of understanding and
          knowledge, in the past when I have worked in high stress environments
          a lack of skill or expertise has often led to negative feedback loops
          within the workplace. I will need to overcome my concern that such
          behaviours will reoccur and ensure that I keep my teammates apprised
          of the situation. I would also like to improve my leadership skills;
          project management is something I would like to undertake in the
          future and the accountability and organisation required of leadership
          is something I would like to develop.
        </p>
        <h3>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
        </h3>
        <p>
          I believe I currently work well with others and am capable of fitting
          into a fluid learning environment. To manage my workload I have
          already begun developing micro-time management skills via the use of
          timers and digital aids. When things get difficult I will ensure that
          I continue to communicate with the team and my facilitators. I will
          also make sure I go through appropriate troubleshooting, using digital
          resources to try and fix a problem. However if the problem persists I
          will reach out and seek help from others.
        </p>
        <h3>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h3>
        <p>
          As explained above, I recognise the importance of ensuring ongoing
          communication with my team and my facilitators when I have exhausted
          my own efforts at troubleshooting. I will use the tech-questions and
          cohort Discord servers, if I need further assistance I will contact my
          facilitator directly via dm.
        </p>
        <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
        <p>
          Ideally, I would hope for them to be amenable and affable in the face
          of my tiring ignorance (lol), within reason. I'd also hope for a
          sustained level of mutual respect for myself and my colleagues, and
          that if any problems arise, they will be dealt with in a professional
          manner.
        </p>
        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>
          Given the hybrid nature of the course I will first attempt to reach
          out to our facilitators over discord, either via DM or in a general
          Discord server, before getting in touch with onsite staff if an issue
          persists.
        </p>
        <h3>My commitment</h3>
        <p>
          I will endeavour to keep up with the workload as best as possible, on
          the understanding that falling behind in a collaborative environment
          affects everyone else just as much as it affects me. Therefore, when I
          feel that I am unable to continue my technical progress alone I will
          reach out for help straight away and let my fellow students know what
          the situation is. I'll look to bring my professionalism to Boot Camp
          every day and will treat it and others with the respect due to a
          workplace. I do not expect everyone to be at their best day in, day
          out and if required will happily lend a hand to anyone who needs it.
          Likewise, I will make sure that I respect my own boundaries and
          capabilities, on the understanding that I can't work ceaselessly
          without time away from the workspace.

        <h3>Using ID and CLASS attributes in CSS</h3>
        <p>
          The building blocks of CSS are called Rulesets: div { text-align:
          left;} These Rulesets are made up of two parts. The selector, which in
          this case is the [div] , which indicates the HTML element to be styled
          by your CSS code. The second part is the declaration block which is
          held within these two parameters { } describes what aspect of the tag
          is to be styled and then how it is to be styled. Selectors then, are a
          useful way of identifying which HTML tags you want to style via your
          CSS sheet, if we used the above CSS Ruleset we would be to align all
          our HTML [div] blocks to the left. But what if we want certain [div] s
          to behave differently than others?
        </p>

        <h4>Attributes and Selectors</h4>
        <p>
          Attributes can be applied to our selectors in order to achieve just
          that. The two main selectors you will generally be using are called:
          #id attributes (identified by its # prefix) and .class attributes
          (identified by its . prefix) #id attributes can only be used to style
          a particular, individual, HTML tag, so you can’t use it more than
          once. Whereas a .class attribute can be used for… a whole class of
          HTML tags.
        </p>

        <h4>Best Practice</h4>
        <p>
          Because of their multi-use applicability, .class attributes are
          considered the most efficient way to interface between CSS and HTML
          tags. A CSS stylesheet will be a lot easier to navigate, and a lot
          smaller, if you can stick to using attribute .classes. However, #id
          attributes do have a specific utility within browsers, that .class
          attributes do not. Because they are used for a single HTML element,
          they can be used by the browser as a link to a specific part of the
          web page. If you apply an #id to an element you can create a URL that
          links directly to that element. In general it is best practice to
          forgo the use of #id attributes in favour of .class attributes as this
          creates a far more streamlined CSS stylesheet.

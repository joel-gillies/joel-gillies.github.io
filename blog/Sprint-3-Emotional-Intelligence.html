        <h3>What does Emotional Intelligence mean?</h3>
        <p>
          EQ was first proposed by researchers Mayer and Salovey in 1990 as way
          in which the field of psychology could identify and research
          differences in individual capabilities related to emotion. This model
          of emotional intelligence led to the creation of tests that were
          designed top gauge the emotional abilities of subjects, and thus, EQ
          (Emotional Quotient) was born.
        </p>

        <p>
          Emotional Intelligence theory has created a model of EQ whereby
          traditional, culturally valenced ideas about the nature of emotions
          are reconfigured. In this reconfigured schema, emotions are an aspect
          of the human intelligence matrix. They become useful sources of
          information regarding the endogenous reactions humans experience in
          response to exogenous stimuli. As Salovey and Mayer defined it (1990),
          emotional intelligence is:
        </p>

        <p class="p-quote">
          “The ability to monitor one’s own and other’s feelings, to
          discriminate among them, and to use this information to guide thinking
          and action.”
        </p class="p-quote">

        <p>
          This has been further refined into four branches of distinct yet
          related “branches” of emotional skills.
        </p>

        <h3>BRANCH 1.0</h3>
        <p>
          The first branch is the ability to perceive and decipher human
          emotions, not only those of others but one’s own too.
        </p>

        <h3>BRANCH 2.0</h3>
        <p>
          The second branch relates to the active use of emotions; moving beyond
          merely “feeling”, an individual can understand emotions (to a degree)
          and thereby apply them to constructive ends. The tail no longer wags
          the dog.
        </p>

        <h3>BRANCH 3.0</h3>
        <p>
          The third branch of emotional intelligence builds upon the second,
          this branch proposes the meta-skill of emotional fluency. This meansan
          individual can “speak” in the language of emotions and is capable of
          discerning small “grammatical” variables between emotional states e.g.
          happiness and ebullience.
        </p>

        <h3>BRANCH 4.0</h3>
        <p>
          The fourth branch deals with the management of emotions and
          encompasses the most complex set of abilities measured by EQ tests.
          The ability to manage emotions, in this case, refers not merely to the
          conscious regulation of one’s own emotions, but to that of other
          individuals as well.
        </p>

        <h3>IQ</h3>
        <p>
          Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is a score derived from standardized tests
          which have been designed to measure human intelligence. Although the
          concept of human intelligence has evolved over time and IQ tests have
          changed in various ways, the foundational concepts of IQ have stayed
          fairly constant.
        </p>

        <h3>IQ x EQ</h3>
        <p>
          Both IQ and EQ measure cognitive capabilities but focus upon two
          distinct regions of socially meaningful praxis. Whereas IQ may be an
          effective predictor of academic success or the ability to excel in
          fields which prize the understanding of highly technical and abstract
          concepts, EQ may be a better predictor of success in areas which
          require interpersonal skills and emotional labour. Individuals with
          high EQs are often successful in roles that require negotiation,
          mediation, collaboration, and that involve caring for or understanding
          the needs of others.

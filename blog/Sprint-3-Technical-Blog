          How do HTML, CSS & JavaScript interact, what the heck is the DOM?
        </h3>
        <p>
          "The easiest way to understand these is the classic "model tree" analogy; whereby the HTML is the trunk, branches and leaves, CSS is the colour of the leaves and the texture of the bark and 
          JavScript is the ability to modify the model without having to assemble and re-assemble it. But surely, in order to modify the model tree (imagine it's a 1:1 scale) you'll need a ladder, in this case is the DOM. 
          The DOM (Document Object Model)is a web API (Application Programming Interface), and although the ladder analogy doesn't exactly line up with what an API actually is, 
          as far as javaScript and Sprint 3 is concerned, it works. (Tod howard image?)

        <h3>
          How is this related to Bloodborne?
        </h3>
        <p>
          A more interesting way to understand these concepts of web development is through the esoteric lore of Bloodborne. 
          HTML is a structure, like the foundations and structure of Yharnam. It forms the streets, buildings, bridges and ladders - the bones of the city. HTMl similarly creates the structure of web pages, creating the framework for text, images and paragraphs. Just as the Cathedral stand tall amongst the spires of Yharnam, so do the headers within the midst of the html.index.
          CSS is used to style the bare bones of HTML, layering over a mesh of layouts, fonts and colours. Similarly the Moon which hangs over Yharnam dresses the city is shadow and light, hues of blood red and ghostly white.
          JavaScript allows web pages to interact with the user, to respond and change to different actions. This is akin to the Eldritch Truth provided by the growing insight of the Hunter (coder),
          that causes statues in the Healing Church garden to whisper secrets
          and awaken slumbering Elder Gods, transforming Yharnam from a nightmare into... a worse nightmare. 
          the DOM encompasses the entire structure of a webpage, including its HTML (the architecture of Yharnam), CSS (the aesthetic of the Dream), and JavaScript (the eldritch truth).
          It is a living model of the webpage, where each element exists as a node in a larger, dynamic network. In this realm, the hunters (or web developers) have the power to interact with and modify the environment. 
          A change to an element within the DOM can ripple through the Dream, altering the appearance of Yharnam (CSS changes), restructuring the streets and edifices (HTML modifications), or awakening unseen forces to action (JavaScript functions). 
          The DOM is the medium through which the coders(hunters) perceive and influence the webpage(world), a reflection that can be transformed through their coding skill (will and insight).

          The Hunter's Choice and Flow Control
        </h3>
        <p>
          Flow control is is all about decisions, deciding whether or not a certain section of code should be executed or not. Imagine you are standing at a lantern lit crossroads in Yharnam;
          to your left, the pathway to Yahar Gul, on your right lies Old Yharnam, by applying the ancient knowledge of if-else conditionals. 
          <image>if else code</image>
          Sometimes you will need to consider a multiplicity of conditionals, ensuring that the right code is executed depending on the right circumstance. 
          Thus when the Hunter faces his foes, he must choose which weapon to wield, this is how we use Switch statements in javaScript

        <h3>
          Loops, The Endless Hunt
        </h3>
        <p>
          The hunt in Yharnam is continuous and cyclical, similar to a for loop in JavaScript.
          Just as a hunter revisits the same dark alleys, battling through waves of beasts night after night, 
          a for loop iterates over a block of code a specified number of times. Loops are powerful tools for effectively handling repetitive tasks that deoend upon the fulfillment of specific conditions.

        <h3>
          Arrays, Objects = Arsenals, Bestiaries
        </h3>
        <p>
          Arrays are simple lists of items arrayed from left to right and assigned positions/index from 0 upwards, meaning the first item in an array is indexed as 0 and the third is 2. 
          The Hunter's arsenal is similar to an Array, each item is placed within a certain slot within the hunter's itinerary, ready to be cycled through when needed. Objects in JavaScript are collections if key-value pairs, 
          in this way they are similar to the Hunter's Bestiary, where each entry contains the details of a beast's domain and it's weakness.

        <h3> Functions and Tools</h3>
        <p>
          Functions enable coders to define a block of code which can be called and executed whenever we want. Functions are similar to the Hunter's Tools, 
          within which are contained certain eldritch powers which when called upon provide the hunter with powerful aids in the hunt.

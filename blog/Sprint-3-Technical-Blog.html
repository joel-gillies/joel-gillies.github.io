          How do HTML, CSS & JavaScript interact, what the heck is the DOM?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The easiest way to understand these is the classic "model tree"
          analogy; whereby the HTML is the trunk, branches and leaves, the CSS
          sheet is the colour of the leaves, the texture of the bark and
          JavScript is the ability to modify the model without having to
          disassemble and re-assemble it. But surely, in order to modify the
          model tree (imagine it's a 1:1 scale) you'll need a some instructions
          and a ladder? This is the DOM. The DOM (Document Object Model) is a
          web API (Application Programming Interface), and although the ladder
          analogy doesn't exactly line up with what an API actually is, as far
          as javaScript and what I've learnt in Sprint 3 are concerned, it
          works... kinda
        </p>
        <h3>Surely there is a better analogy?</h3>
        <p>
          A more interesting way to understand these concepts of web development
          is through the esoteric lore of Bloodborne. HTML is a structure, like
          the foundations and structure of Yharnam. It forms the streets,
          buildings, bridges and ladders - the bones of the city. HTML similarly
          creates the structure of web pages, creating the framework for text,
          images and paragraphs. Just as the Cathedral stands tall amongst the
          spires of Yharnam, so do the headers within the midst of the
          html.index. CSS is used to style the bare bones of HTML, layering over
          a mesh of layouts, fonts and colours. Similarly the Moon which hangs
          over Yharnam dresses the city is shadow and light, with hues of blood
          red and ghostly white.

          alt="City of Yharnam or a Webpage?"
        />

        <p>
          JavaScript allows users to interact with web pages, to respond and
          change to different actions. This is akin to the Eldritch Truth
          provided by the growing insight of the Hunter (coder), that causes
          statues in the Healing Church garden to whisper secrets and awaken
          slumbering Elder Gods, transforming Yharnam from a nightmare into...
          an even worse nightmare.
        </p>

        />

        <p>
          The DOM encompasses the entire structure of a webpage, including its
          HTML (the architecture of Yharnam), CSS (the aesthetic of the Dream),
          and JavaScript (the eldritch truth). It is a living model of the
          webpage, where each element exists as a node in a larger, dynamic
          network. In this realm, the hunters (or web developers) have the power
          to interact with and modify the environment. A change to an element
          within the DOM can ripple through the Dream, altering the appearance
          of Yharnam (CSS changes), restructuring the streets and edifices (HTML
          modifications), or awakening unseen forces to action (JavaScript
          functions). The DOM is the medium through which the coders(hunters)
          perceive and influence the webpage(world), a reflection that can be
          transformed through their coding skill (will and insight).

        <h3>The Hunter's Choice and Flow Control</h3>
        <p>
          Flow control is is all about decisions, deciding whether or not a
          certain section of code should be executed or not. Imagine you are
          standing at a lantern lit crossroads in Yharnam; to your left, the
          pathway to Yahar Gul, on your right lies Old Yharnam, by applying the
          ancient knowledge of if-else conditionals.
        </p>

        <img

          alt="Flow control image"
        />
        <p>
          Sometimes you will need to consider a multiplicity of conditionals,
          ensuring that the right code is executed depending on the right
          circumstance. Thus when the Hunter faces his foes, he must choose
          which weapon to wield, this is how we use Switch statements in
          javaScript
        </p>

          alt="Switch Statement image"
        />

        <h3>Loops, The Endless Hunt</h3>
        <p>
          The hunt in Yharnam is continuous and cyclical, similar to a for loop
          in JavaScript. Just as a hunter revisits the same dark alleys,
          battling through waves of beasts night after night, a for loop
          iterates over a block of code a specified number of times. Loops are
          powerful tools for effectively handling repetitive tasks that depend
          upon the fulfillment of specific conditions.
        </p>

          alt="Loops code image"
        />
        <h3>Arrays, Objects = Arsenals, Bestiaries</h3>
        <p>
          Arrays are simple lists of items arrayed from left to right and
          assigned positions/index from 0 upwards, meaning the first item in an
          array is indexed as 0 and the third is 2. The Hunter's arsenal is
          similar to an Array, each item is placed within a certain slot within
          the hunter's itinerary, ready to be cycled through when needed.
          Objects in JavaScript are collections if key-value pairs, in this way
          they are similar to the Hunter's Bestiary, where each entry contains
          the details of a beast's domain and it's weakness.
        </p>

        />

        <h3>Functions and Tools</h3>
        <p>
          Functions enable coders to define a block of code which can be called
          and executed whenever we want. Functions are similar to the Hunter's
          Tools, within which are contained certain eldritch powers which when
          called upon provide the hunter with powerful aids in the hunt.

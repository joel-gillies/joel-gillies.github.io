        <h3>Linking the Flame</h3>
        <p>
          Dark Souls is a now (in)famous series of games, part of a wider
          catalogue, from the Japanese game development studio, FromSoftware.
          Its infamy/fame has arisen as a result of two strange and interlinked
          fundamental design concepts; the player must experience the game a set
          of pseudo-sisyphean struggles and at no point can they expect
          enlightenment through narrative dumping.For most people, when
          confronted with this type of experience, the natural reaction is one
          of exasperated frustration and, no doubt, the throwing of controller's
          across the room. Their mistake, and my own initially, is to
          incorrectly assume that the game developers are suggesting they are
          not good enough to play. When in fact, they are being told to
          persevere through repeated failure, learn, adapt and "get good". Dark
          Souls was in fact challenging players to adapt what has since become
          know as, Growth Mindset. Through a form of recursive learning which
          engages a process of cognitive growth via neural plasticity, alongside
          a healthy and positive relationship with challenge, the player not
          only becomes happy, like sisyphus, but also breaks free of their
          digital groundhog day.

        <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganise itself by
          forming new neural connections throughout life. This allows neurons in
          the brain to compensate for TBI, brain disease as well as respond to
          novel challenges created by new exogenous stimuli e.g. learning to
          code!
        </p>

        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>
          Growth mindset is concept developed by psychologist Carol Dweck; it is
          a belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through hard
          work. Individuals with a growth a mindset embrace challenge, persist
          in the face of defeat, view effort as a path to mastery, learn from
          criticism and find inspiration in the achievements of others.
        </p>

        <h3>Linking</h3>
        <p>
          Both concepts are mutually reinforcing, the understanding one can
          augment the application of the other. Going forward, as part of my
          mindfulness exercise, I will remember the central precepts of both
          neuroplasticity and growth mindset. Remembering that neuroplasticity
          proves that a new dog can in fact be taught new tricks enables me to
          be open to the idea that failure and difficulty doesn't mean the
          closing of another door, rather that they represent the possibilities
          of an open one.

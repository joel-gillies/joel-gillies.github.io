        <h3>Taha Tinana</h3>
        <p>
          My physical wellbeing is important to me, I try to make sure I swim
          twice a week (feeling somewhat weightless is a great way to destress),
          I also attend Muay Thai training three to four times a week.
        </p>
        <h3>Taha WhÄnau</h3>
        <p>
          I've made sure to make time for family over the next few months, and
          will keep up the regular date nights me and my partner have, even when
          things get busy.
        </p>
        <h3>Taha Hinengaro</h3>
        <p>
          I'll try to keep in mind what we have been learning about during our
          Foundations Core exercises, especially this weeks one. Growth mindset
          seems like a pretty powerful set of behavioural tools when learning
          new things.
        </p>
        <h3>Taha Wairua</h3>
        <p>
          I've really appreciated the short meditative sessions I've undertaken
          in the morning before turning on the computer, and will try to keep up
          with them during Bootcamp.
        </p>
        <h3>Whenua</h3>
        <p>
          I think that going on bush walk every Sunday is a good, and achievable
          goal. After so much time spent looking at a screen, spending time
          walking through the bush without a phone will be a great way to
          recharge.

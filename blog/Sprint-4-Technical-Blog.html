        <h3>The Brick Wall I Ran Into</h3>
        <p>
          I got stuck quite a lot this week, especially during the JavaScript
          Kata. For the first two Kata, I felt like understood "the
          surroundings", and that I was dealing with known knowns and known
          unknowns... Probably a few unknown knowns too! But from the third Kata
          onwards I felt like I was in a foreign land and everyone was speaking
          Hungarian and the map was in Greek. That is, I was dealing with
          unknown knowns and unknown unknowns. The most enlightening moment was
          when I was writing a .split() function and then a .join() function. To
          me it seemed like my code should be working, but the tests were still
          coming back negative. I started testing it using P5 and realised my
          function and join methods weren't doing what I wanted them to. I had
          forgotten to place a '\_' within their brackets. This is the latest in
          a series of learning moments over the past few weeks where my
          attention to detail and reading comprehension has been found lacking.
          It's been really cool to realise that when put under new forms of
          stress and strain, my weak points become apparent and at the same time
          appear more fixable.
        </p>
        <h3>Elegance in Problem Solving</h3>
        <p>
          I am not sure if any of my coding could be considered elegant at this
          point, but I did quite enjoy using the a .find() method in the
          "whereAreYou" part of the 5th Kata. It really brought home to me the
          importance of taking the time to read instructions, read over the code
          at hand and think about what it is you are really being asked to do.
          Despite the relatively large amount of code within which Scooby was
          hiding, the resolution was relatively simple, short and sweet.
        </p>

        <h3>The Technique of Talking to (Rubber) Ducks</h3>

        <h4>Pseudo-Code</h4>
        <p>
          I feel quite comfortable using pseudo code, and I think it is the
          technique I have had the most success with. Removing the problem
          presented from the coding syntax downward into its own domain and
          applying structured, but simple, English to it. It then becomes a
          plain language narrative where the code is restructured as a single
          construct with a beginning and end. The formality is introduced using
          a simple language control flow: While For If-Else etc. For myself, it
          makes coding far less about byzantine syntax (which at this stage is
          incredibly arcane to me) and more about problem solving. It also acts
          as a learning format, as translating actual code into pseudo code and
          back helps me understand syntax and semantics (bit by bit).
        </p>

        <h4>Quacks and Quackery</h4>
        <p>
          I was pretty keen (but also put off by the oddness of it) to try
          rubber ducking, and it did work quite well alongside pseudo coding.
          Speaking the problem out loud to myself forced me to be purposeful
          with my words, I couldn't simply stream of consciousness whatever came
          into my head. I tried that and it made no sense. Likewise, it helped
          me check my pseudo code once I had written it, when there was a
          logical error or aspect of the challenge I had misunderstood it became
          obvious.
        </p>

        <h4>Google</h4>
        <p>
          Google can be a mixed bag, especially when you are searching for
          information on concepts you yourself are barely familiar with. Many of
          the resources provided can themselves be a chore to understand. But
          having used it for years at university, I feel pretty comfortable with
          my ability to pose queries which return quality results (more often
          than not).
        </p>

        <h4>Console Logging and ERROR messages</h4>
        <p>
          I can definitely see the utility of console logging and error
          messages, I thought the Kata exercise was really excellent at
          illustrating this. Unfortunately I do not use Console Logging nearly
          enough, because I don;t yet feel very comfortable with it. But going
          forward this will be something I force myself to do at every
          opportunity. The error messages, thought sometimes still a bit
          cryptic, were a great signpost to issues that otherwise may have
          remained somewhat opaque.
        </p>

        <h4>Asking for Help</h4>
        <p>
          I am terrible at asking for help within structured learning
          environments, no doubt a hold over from being the dunce of Highschool
          Mathematics! When you post a question in a discord server, there is no
          way to keep you supposedly embarrassing ignorance between yourself and
          your tutor. This will be something that just takes practice, the more
          you ask, the less foolish you feel. Questions may be indeed be stupid,
          but not asking them is infinitely more so.

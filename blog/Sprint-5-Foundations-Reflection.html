          What Are New Things You Have Learnt About Yourself And Your Ego?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I've learned that I tend to give up when the learning curve of a new
          subject begins to enter the zone of incomprehension.
        </p>

        <h3>
          What Are The Roles Of Value, Empathy & Self-Awareness In learning And
          Programming?
        </h3>
        <p>
          In so far as they shape our view of the world, values have a large
          impact on the way that we learn. Empathy is always an invaluable tool
          for understanding oneâ€™s own reaction to new things as well as those of
          others. Without empathetic reasoning, our reflections would be shallow
          and hardly enlightening. Self-awareness has been a huge boon for me
          during Foundations, and no doubt will continue to be so as we progress
          through Bootcamp. Somewhat like a watch tower, it lets you survey
          yourself; emotions, thought etc. and to notice if they begin to adhere
          to certain recognisable patterns that might indicate stress,
          discomfort or upset. Thus, we can deescalate and deconstruct these
          patterns and replace them with more constructive ones instead.

        <h3>What Has Surprised You The Most About The Core Learning?</h3>
        <p>
          Core learning has surprised me by realising that it isn't simply "hot
          air", that much of what we have learned are in fact hight useful tools
          that are applicable through much of life. It has also been a pleasant
          surprise to be able to read other peoples Core Blog Posts.
        </p>

        <h3>What Were The Most Challenging Aspects Of The Core Learning?</h3>
        <p>
          For myself, creating meaningful learning and self-care plans was
          hardest, as I struggle with forming actionable learning plans when I
          am unfamiliar with the subject matter. But just following the
          guidelines (like the time boxes) let me create a complete weekly
          planner.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Why Do You Think We, A Programming School, Are Spending So Much Time
          Focusing On Core Learning In A Web Development Bootcamp Course?
        </h3>
        <p>
          My own experience suggests that the Core competencies are useful tools
          worth learning, at least for complete beginners such as myself. They
          also allowed for some psychological decompression between the Tech
          sprints, so that I continuously learning but not continuously problem
          solving.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Does Core Feel Like A Waste Of Time? Would It Have Been Time Better
          Spent On Coding?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I may have preferred some more time to code, being so new to it I
          found myself feeling anxious that every minute of the working day was
          not dedicated to it. But the Core competencies have opened certain
          avenues of thought that I was previously disinterested or even unaware
          of. Reading about Growth mindset and neuroplasticity lead me to begin
          reading about the concepts of Grit and Mastery, which have helped me
          overcome my deeply held inclination to give up when I fail to
          understand a problem, let alone grasp how to solve it.
